# Food Delivery App Portfolio Project Plan

This document outlines the plan for creating a comprehensive food delivery application.

## 1. Project Overview

The project is a multi-faceted food delivery platform consisting of five separate frontend applications and a unified backend.

*   **Customer App:** Allows customers to browse restaurants, place orders, make payments, and track deliveries.
*   **Restaurant App:** Enables restaurant partners to manage their menu, process incoming orders, and view their earnings.
*   **Courier App:** Provides delivery agents with tools to accept delivery jobs, navigate to restaurants and customers, and manage their delivery schedule.
*   **Admin Panel:** A dashboard for administrators to oversee the entire system, manage users, view analytics, and handle operational tasks.
*   **Affiliate App:** A platform for partners to generate affiliate links, track referrals, and manage earnings.

## 2. Technology Stack

*   **Customer App:** Next.js
*   **Restaurant App:** React
*   **Courier App:** Next.js
*   **Admin Panel:** Angular
*   **Affiliate App:** React
*   **Backend:** NestJS
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (or another relational database)
*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## 3. Project Structure

A monorepo structure will be used to manage the different parts of the application. The use of a Turborepo is a good option here, as long as the latest versions of all technologies can be used.
